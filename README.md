# 🐍 Python Snake Game

A simple yet engaging **Snake Game** created using Python. This project serves as a hands-on approach to understanding **Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)** concepts, such as classes, inheritance, and methods, while exploring the **Turtle Graphics Library** for visual elements.

---

## 🚀 Features

* **Dynamic Gameplay**: The snake grows as it eats food.
* **Scoreboard**: Tracks your score dynamically.
* **Collision Detection**: Ends the game if the snake collides with itself or boundaries.
* **Keyboard Controls**: Smooth movement using arrow keys.
